- [x] plant uml support in the editor @nice

### Nice to Haves
---
- [x] extend tagging to pages, not just tasks @nice
	this is probably a key feature for some, i don't use it much bit i might start.
  - tags that are not part of a task....
  - should have a 'tag' on global search
  - probably implement global search first then.  [:FullTextSearch:StillPointDevelopment:App:FullTextSearch
