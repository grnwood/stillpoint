	* add the page text into chroma by default?
	* (#) hash tag loads list of file attachements from page?
	* (@) allows linking to any other page in the notebook
	  * How to handle subfolders, etc?
	* Delete has to remove from chroma or get to big.
	* Chroma per chat?  or global chroma file for the whole app?
