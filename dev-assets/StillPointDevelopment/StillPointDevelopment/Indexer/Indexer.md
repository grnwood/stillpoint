### Indexer and Link Nav
---
- [x] sometimes ctrl-l link adding is give bad link targets: @index

- [ ] lets fix the font and make it solid white, maybe have it scale down with the view size @link
- [x] if a back / forward / nav path results in a 404, remove it from recent links and history buffer @link
- [x] remember prefered / last used view and persist it @link
- [x] something is still very wrong with camel links and colon link resoultion. @edit
- [ ] need a way to print my tasks (esp. the current filter... print to browser?) @task
- [x] double check the searching seems to not be filtering right (tags and tasks text?) @task
	e.g. if i have a task tagged with multiples... it doesn't seem to 'and' the filtering (select tag1, should filter by that, etc) @task
- [x] move my indicators to the right of the panel so the panel shrinks better @task
	Or, a better treatment?
- [x] hierarchial tasks should show a slight visual representation in task bar @task
- [x] support hiearchy assignment  @task
- [x] if all tasks on a tag are complete, tag comes out of tags filter (unless show completed is selected)  @task
- [x] if tree is filtered, filter the tasks panel based on tree and sub pages? @task
	(show red filtered message next to tags label)
- [x] need a way to AI chat with my tasks. @task
- [x] when flipping toggles on tasks we should update the number next to the tag so counts and data match up. @task
