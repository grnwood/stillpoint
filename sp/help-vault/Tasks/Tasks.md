# Tasks

## What Are Tasks?
Tasks are checkboxes in your Markdown notes.
- They help track to-dos alongside your regular notes.
- No separate task app needed - tasks live with your content.

## Task Syntax
- `- [ ]` for open tasks
- `- [x]` for completed tasks
Example:
```markdown
# Project Tasks

- [ ] Research competitors
- [x] Set up meeting
- [ ] Write report
```

## Task Panel
The Tasks panel shows all tasks from your vault.
- Click a task to jump to its page.
- Double-click to toggle completion.
- Use the search box to filter tasks.

## Filtering Tasks
- Type keywords to find specific tasks.
- Use tags like `@work` or `@personal`.
- Add dates like `2025-01-15` for scheduling.
Example filters:
- `@work` - show work-related tasks
- `meeting` - show tasks mentioning meetings

## Actionable Tasks
The 'Show tasks you can act on now' toggle hides:
- Completed tasks
- Tasks with unfinished subtasks
- Tasks marked as non-actionable (like @wait)

## Organizing Tasks
- Group related tasks under headings.
- Use tags for categories.
- Create separate pages for big projects.

## Tips
- Keep tasks near the notes they relate to.
- Review your task list daily.
- Use dates for time-sensitive items.
