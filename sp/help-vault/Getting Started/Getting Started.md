# Getting Started

StillPoint works with simple folders and Markdown files. A vault is just a folder on disk.

## Create or Open a Vault
1. Choose **Vault -> Open Vault** and select a folder.
2. StillPoint reads the folder tree and builds the navigation view.
3. Your notes are regular `.md` files you can access outside of StillPoint.

## Create Your First Page
- Use the left panel to create a new page.
- Type a title at the top as a heading.
- Save with Ctrl+S (or let autosave handle it).

## Organizing Your Notes
- **Drag and drop** pages within the same folder to reorder them.
- **Right-click → "Move To..."** to relocate a page or folder to a different parent.
- Right-click in the tree for options like Rename, Delete, and New Page.
