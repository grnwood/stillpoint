# Modes

## What Are Modes?
Modes change how the interface behaves for different tasks.
- **Normal Mode**: Full interface with all panels

- **VI Mode**: Vim-style keyboard navigation
- **Audience Mode**: Presentation view

## Normal Mode
The default interface:
- All panels visible (Tasks, Calendar, Links, etc.)
- Full toolbar and menus
- Best for general note-taking and organization

## Focus Mode
For distraction-free writing:
- Hide all panels except the editor
- Clean, minimal interface
- Toggle with View → Focus Mode or Ctrl+Shift+F
- Perfect for deep writing sessions

## VI Mode
Vim-style editing:
- Use keyboard shortcuts for navigation
- `Esc` to enter command mode
- `i` to enter insert mode
- `h/j/k/l` for movement
- Enable in Preferences → Editor → VI Mode

## Audience Mode
For presentations:
- Large, readable text
- Hide editing controls
- Navigate with keyboard or mouse
- Toggle with View → Audience Mode

## Switching Modes
