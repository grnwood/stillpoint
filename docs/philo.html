            StillPoint is not for dashboards, metrics, or turning your life into a system. It is for
            writing things down and being able to find them again.

              Notes live on your computer as real files you control. No accounts, no

              You open a page and type. Organization emerges naturally as you link ideas
              together over time. StillPoint never demands structure upfront.

            <h3>Tools should get out of the way</h3>

              StillPoint stays quiet when you need focus and reveals connections when you need
              context. The tool adapts to you, not the other way around.

              A checkbox is still a checkbox. A link is still a link. StillPoint avoids turning
              basic writing into heavy workflows.

          If StillPoint disappeared tomorrow, your notes would still be there — readable, editable,

          StillPoint only drops a hidden '.stillpoint' folder and a couple of sqllite databases in your vault folder.
          If you delete those, StillPoint simply rebuilds its context and indexes from your plain text files.
          <b>YOUR NOTES</b> are <b>ALWAYS</b> the source of truth and StillPoint just builds around them.

        <h2>A thank you to <a href="https://zim-wiki.org/">Zim Wiki</a>.</h2>
        <p>
          StillPoint exists because <a href="https://zim-wiki.org/">Zim</a> proved the model. I used Zim for over a decade with
          thousands of folders and notes. It was bulletproof, stood the test of time, and
          never lost a page. That durability is the bar StillPoint aims to keep.
          As a young consultant in 2007, I found Zim Wiki and it changed how I worked. Finally, I had a tool
          that let me write naturally, link ideas together, and keep everything local. Over
          the years, Zim became my trusted brain for projects, research, and personal notes.
          When I started building StillPoint, I wanted to honor that legacy while improving the
          experience with modern design, performance, and features.
